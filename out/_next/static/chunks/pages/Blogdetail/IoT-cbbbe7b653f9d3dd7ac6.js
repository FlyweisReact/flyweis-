This includes everything from fitness trackers and smart watches to smart refrigerators, headphones, cameras, washing machines, cars, traffic lights, airplane engines, and home security systems.As access to broadband Internet service grows and processors become more affordable, more and more gadgets with Wi-Fi capabilities are being created. Today there are billions of IoT devices in existence.this network of devices produces great benefits and convenience for users, but IoT devices can also be targeted by attackers as well as used to carry out cyber attacks. As with internet-connected computers, these devices are perfectly safe to use, but precautions should be taken to ensure they aren\u2019t compromised.\u2018Internet of Things\u2019 in, but developers have been playing with the idea of internet-connected devices since the early. In fact, the first IoT device was a modified soda machine made in that transmitted data about its inventory and the temperature of the drinks inside. This was a one-off prototype, and the widespread proliferation of IoT devices didn\u2019t start for another 25 years. Two technologies helped pave the way for the mass manufacture of IoT devices: RFID tags and IPv6 IP addresses. RFID tags are small, lightweight electronic sensors that can transmit information without a power source, and they can be produced at very low cost. These tags can be as small as a grain of rice, and their use has been widely adopted in the industrial sector. RFID tags used in conjunction with IoT devices have been used to track inventory in a warehouse, parts on an assembly line, and even patients in a hospital. This practice has saved countless hours of labor. The industrial sector was also the first to use IoT-based security systems, incorporating devices like smart cameras and smart locks.the introduction of IPv6 addresses meant that the dwindling number of IP addresses for internet devices was a problem of the past, and helped open the floodgates for the mass production of consumer IoT devices. The \u2018smart home\u2019 concept has also been a major driving factor in bringing IoT devices to the hands of consumers, creating a heavy demand for things like smart home security systems, cameras, televisions, speakers (e.g. Google Home), lighting, and thermostats. the first one is the devices themselves. Devices with either a flawed or outdated design can present rich targets for attackers. In the past, device security was often an afterthought, so proper security didn\u2019t get designed into the product. Newer devices with a proper security design can still have security bugs in their firmware, which requires that they be updated whenever these bugs are found. Applications and software present the third vector for IoT attacks."})]})}),(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-lg-4",children:[(0,c.jsx)(n.Z,{}),(0,c.jsx)(r.Z,{})]})]})})}),(0,c.jsx)(i.Z,{})]})}},9303:function(e,s,t){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/Blogdetail/IoT",function(){return t(8636)}])}},function(e){e.O(0,[9774,260,4617,3974,9669,8249,8160,6625,2888,179],(function(){return s=9303,e(e.s=s);var s}));var s=e.O();_N_E=s}]);
