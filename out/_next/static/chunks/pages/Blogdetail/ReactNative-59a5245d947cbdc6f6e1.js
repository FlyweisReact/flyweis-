React Native has been successfully adopted by hundreds of businesses worldwide, including Uber, Microsoft, and Facebook, and is used across a whole range of industries. React Native is a JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps. It uses the React framework and offers large amount of inbuilt components and APIs. React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native - It is a framework for creating mobile applications with a native feel. ReactJs - React is a JavaScript library for building Responsive User Interfaces for Building Web Application. React (also known as ReactJS) is a JavaScript library used for building the frontend of a website. Similarly to React Native, it was also developed by the Facebook engineering team. React Native Advantages is You can use the existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps and You can share most of your code on different platforms. The community around React and React Native is large, and you will be able to find any answer you need. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end user\u2019s experience or application quality. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end user\u2019s experience or application quality. React Native does not force you to work in Xcode to develop for iOS, or Android Studio for Android development. Besides the day-to-day improvements to your development experience, React Native also has the potential to positively impact your product release cycle. For instance, Apple permits JavaScript-based changes to an app\u2019s behavior to be loaded over the air with no additional review cycle necessary. Being able to reuse code is the biggest advantage of React Native, and it indicates that apps can run effectively on multiple platforms \u2013 which is something that CEOs and Product Owners truly appreciate. Live reloading reloads or refreshes the entire app when a file changes. For example, if you were four links deep into your navigation and saved a change, live reloading would restart the app and load the app back to the initial route.They can integrate 90% of the native framework for reusing the code for both operational systems. Another great piece of news is that it\u2019s possible to use the web application code for mobile app development if they\u2019re both using React Native. It also speeds up development time as it includes pre-developed components, which are included in the open-source library. If the existing modules do not meet the business requirement in React Native we can also use Third Party plugins which may help to speed up the development process."})]})}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-lg-4",children:[(0,d.jsx)(o.Z,{}),(0,d.jsx)(n.Z,{})]})]})})}),(0,d.jsx)(s.Z,{})]})}},5407:function(e,a,i){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/Blogdetail/ReactNative",function(){return i(9088)}])}},function(e){e.O(0,[9774,260,4617,3974,9669,8160,9274,2888,179],(function(){return a=5407,e(e.s=a);var a}));var a=e.O();_N_E=a}]);
