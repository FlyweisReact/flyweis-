However, the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies has encouraged cybercriminals to find innovative ways to attack the underlying blockchain. One of these ways is 51% attack\u201d, which has evolved in recent years and has been quite successful. Numerous 51% attacks have taken place in recent years. In August 2021, Bitcoin SV (BSV) slid about 5 per cent value after an attack. Another Bitcoin fork, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), suffered a 51% attack in 2019. Ethereum Classic (ETC), which forked from the original Ethereum blockchain after the infamous DAO hack of 2016, has seen 51% attacks several times. A hack in cryptocurrency can be many things. In simple words, if an attacker is able to exploit some area of a chain, smart contract, exchange or illegitimately withdraw cryptocurrency, it would be deemed as a hack or stealing. cryptocurrencies are encrypted using blockchain technology, which is a public ledger that helps verify and record transactions. Blockchain is constantly reviewed by a network of users, which makes it difficult to hack.When it comes to blockchains that use proof of work , 51% of attacks involve the attacker being able to gain control of more than 50 per cent of the hashing power. By doing so, he or she is able to manipulate the data in the blockchain,. it\u2019s almost impossible to pull that off in established blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This phenomenon has been experienced by some small chains that are not really decentralised, he added.attacks help hackers use one digital token more than once by duplicating the file. 51% attack enables them to rewrite transaction history and carry out double spends. In a double spend, transactions are erased once the goods are received. This means that the tokens can be used again. Each crypto account is locked down by unbreakable cryptography and a private key \u2014 a string of letters and numbers \u2014 that serves as an identification code for each crypto account holder. But hackers have shown that blockchains are not immutable.poorly coded smart contract can be hacked by someone sending certain instructions to it. In short, the smart contract itself can be hacked, but not the blockchain.If hackers get access to a wallet, they will be able to crack the private key to the account, which is another way of crypto hacking.the data in the blockchain is immutable. Even in these hacks, the blockchain is mostly not compromised, he added.Many countries have deemed crypto hacking illegal. The most common types of crypto hacking are phishing and social engineering attacks. However, when it comes to 51% attacks, there are not many laws that prevent miners from taking control of more than 50 per cent of a network\u2019s computing power.Though rare, more devastating attacks happen where smart contracts get hacked or exploited, giving the hacker access to large parts of a crypto company's accounts and systems, said Huobi Global. \u201cThey are able to steal crypto tokens worth millions at one go,\u201d he added.However, hackings can be goodwill gestures, too.

Today there are billions of IoT devices in existence.this network of devices produces great benefits and convenience for users, but IoT devices can also be targeted by attackers as well as used to carry out cyber attacks.

In fact, the first IoT device was a modified soda machine made in that transmitted data about its inventory and the temperature of the drinks inside. This was a one-off prototype, and the widespread proliferation of IoT devices didn\u2019t start for another 25 years. Two technologies helped pave the way for the mass manufacture of IoT devices: RFID tags and IPv6 IP addresses. RFID tags are small, lightweight electronic sensors that can transmit information without a power source, and they can be produced at very low cost. These tags can be as small as a grain of rice, and their use has been widely adopted in the industrial sector. RFID tags used in conjunction with IoT devices have been used to track inventory in a warehouse, parts on an assembly line, and even patients in a hospital. This practice has saved countless hours of labor. The industrial sector was also the first to use IoT-based security systems, incorporating devices like smart cameras and smart locks.the introduction of IPv6 addresses meant that the dwindling number of IP addresses for internet devices was a problem of the past, and helped open the floodgates for the mass production of consumer IoT devices. The \u2018smart home\u2019 concept has also been a major driving factor in bringing IoT devices to the hands of consumers, creating a heavy demand for things like smart home security systems, cameras, televisions, speakers (e.g. Google Home), lighting, and thermostats. the first one is the devices themselves. Devices with either a flawed or outdated design can present rich targets for attackers. In the past, device security was often an afterthought, so proper security didn\u2019t get designed into the product. Newer devices with a proper security design can still have security bugs in their firmware, which requires that they be updated whenever these bugs are found.
